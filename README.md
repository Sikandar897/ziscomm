This is a Flutter project built using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. The application leverages fake APIs from [reqres.in](https://reqres.in/) for data retrieval and testing purposes.

## API Integration

The project uses fake APIs from [reqres.in](https://reqres.in/) for simulating data fetching and processing. These APIs provide a simple and convenient way to test various scenarios related to network requests.

## Dependencies

- Flutter: [link to Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http): For making HTTP requests to the fake APIs.
- [spinkit](https://pub.dev/packages/spinkit): For adding animated loading indicators.
- Other dependencies as specified in the `pubspec.yaml` file.

## Animated Indicators
